    "text": "At Clarot’s German Shepherds, we strive to produce dogs who embody superior temperament, correct conformation, a keen will to work and above all great health. Our selective breeding program allows you to choose from the finest blood lines Germany has to offer. Our love for the German Shepherd dog started over 30 years ago. I have enjoyed working with my dogs both in the sport of Schutzhund and in the show ring. The ideal German Shepherd dog is a working dog with a reliable character that shows a strong degree of beauty and nobility.\n\nI am among countless people worldwide whose lives are richer for knowing and loving a German Shepherd, the most versatile of dog breeds. The breed was developed to serve man and woman, and also to work for us and with us.\n\nAs a breeder, it is my goal to continue producing dogs that are loyal and amazing companions that are able to succeed and adapt to the lifestyle that they are given."

As a Mother of 2 girls ages 7&9 and also an inexperienced dog owner I was very pleased with Lino’s Knowledge and experience with German Shepherd’s and very thankful as well that any questions I asked he was able to answer. His support both before and after bringing Tasha home has been greatly appreciated. I would definitely recommend Clarot’s to anyone looking for the highest quality in both breeders and German Shepherd’s. Thank you so much Lino!",

      "text": "For me, good temperament is paramount for a family pet and Amara’s temperament is wonderful. She played with many dogs tonight, including a few new ones and although the energy level rose quite high, we never saw her pass her threshold. Not even remotely! That’s amazing, especially for her first time on a Thursday night with a bunch of high energy dogs. I am very impressed with this dog. I am also impressed with the amount of self confidence and confidence she has. When things escalated between other dogs, she didn’t shy back nor become reactive to the situation. She has a great deal of control over her emotions. She is forgiving, but not too forgiving, which is absolutely perfect as a family pet.",

      "body": "German shepherds are very loyal companions. They both make excellent pets. The easiest way to decide is tell the breeder your current situation at home i.e. Do you have other pets? Are they males or females? How much time do you have? Have you had shepherds before? His/her experience can be very helpful when making that decision."
